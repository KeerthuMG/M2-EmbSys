## SIMPLE EMBEDDED SYSTEM: Smart Health Tracker Watch ##

Smart watch is a wearable mini smartphone. Smart watch provides touch screen interface, this smartwatch has many potential capabilities, like message notifications, GPS navigation and calendar synchronization. Smart watch provides touch screen interface, this smartwatch has many potential capabilities, like message notifications, GPS navigation and calendar synchronization.  Many Senior Citizens are retired and most of them suffer from major and minor health issues which affects their routine life.

Our proposed system serves as a solution to this problem, it keeps tracking the health status of the seniors and sends the health status like heart rate, humidity through SMS to the respective care taker once in every min. If the elder person falls or collapses down it will send an immediate SMS and location to the caretaker. This system is powered by Atmega328. It consists of LCD display, GPS, temperature sensor, fall detection sensor, and heart rate sensor.

## COMPONENTS ##

1.	Rectifier: An electrical device which converts an alternating current into a direct one by allowing a current to flow through it in one direction only.

2.	Regulator: It maintains the voltage of the system.

3.	Temperature Sensor: It monitors the user’s temperature.

4.	Heart rate Sensor: It monitors the user’s heart rate by measuring the electrical signals from the heart.

5.	Accelerometer Sensor: It measures the movement changes over time, like walking, running, cycling or sleeping.

6.	Humidity Sensor: It measures and reports the temperature of the environment.

7.	Gyro meter: It senses the angular velocity.

8.	GSM Modem: It used GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a remote network.

9.	Microcontroller Atmega328: The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family. It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.


## COMPLEX EMBEDDED SYSTEM: Home Automation ##

Home automation is called as Smart Home. A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. 
Now considering room scenario, an Arduino UNO will control devices and reads sensor data. The figure "Room Architecture" depicts how the Arduino UNO will connects with the devices and sensors. Room has multiple controllable devices (i.e., Lights, Fan, Wall Socket, etc.), one PassiveIR (to detect human presence in the room), one temperature sensor (LM35 to collect room temperature) and LDR (to detect light intensity near room window).

## COMPONENTS ##

1.  Relay: This allows you to turn on and off fan, light and television. 

2.	IR Sensor and Servo Motor: Both together is used to open the gate.

3.	PIR Sensor: It will detect the motion and will turn on the light automatically.

4.	Ultrasonic Sensor: If the motion is in front of this sensor, television will be turned on.

5.	Bluetooth Sensor: It is something to which all the other components are connected to it. And through this we can control all other components.

6.	Temperature Sensor: It is connected with a LED, when the temperature is more than the required one, the LED will be glowing.
