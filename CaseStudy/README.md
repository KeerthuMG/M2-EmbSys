## SIMPLE EMBEDDED SYSTEM: Smart Health Tracker Watch ##

Smart watch is a wearable mini smartphone. Smart watch provides touch screen interface, this smartwatch has many potential capabilities, like message notifications, GPS navigation and calendar synchronization. Smart watch provides touch screen interface, this smartwatch has many potential capabilities, like message notifications, GPS navigation and calendar synchronization.  Many Senior Citizens are retired and most of them suffer from major and minor health issues which affects their routine life.

Our proposed system serves as a solution to this problem, it keeps tracking the health status of the seniors and sends the health status like heart rate, humidity through SMS to the respective care taker once in every min. If the elder person falls or collapses down it will send an immediate SMS and location to the caretaker. This system is powered by Atmega328. It consists of LCD display, GPS, temperature sensor, fall detection sensor, and heart rate sensor.

## COMPONENTS ##

1.	Rectifier: An electrical device which converts an alternating current into a direct one by allowing a current to flow through it in one direction only.

2.	Regulator: It maintains the voltage of the system.

3.	Temperature Sensor: It monitors the user’s temperature.

4.	Heart rate Sensor: It monitors the user’s heart rate by measuring the electrical signals from the heart.

5.	Accelerometer Sensor: It measures the movement changes over time, like walking, running, cycling or sleeping.

6.	Humidity Sensor: It measures and reports the temperature of the environment.

7.	Gyro meter: It senses the angular velocity.

8.	GSM Modem: It used GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a remote network.

9.	Microcontroller Atmega328: The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family. It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.
